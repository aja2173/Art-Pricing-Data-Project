# Data Science Internship - Interview Task

## Original README
The original readme file is now called TASKREADME.md

## The Predict Function

To import the predict function, use 
    <from model import predict>

The model.py file assumes the data.csv is in the same directory, it trains and tests the model with every call to predict.

To predict
    predict(csv_file)
    
where csv_file is the path of the test data.

Predict will output only the RMSE value, not the actual predictions
